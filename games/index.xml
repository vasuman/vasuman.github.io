As the device tilts, the perspective of the camera also tilts giving the illusion of a fixed surface. The player taps on the screen to fire in that direction.
The ground texture is supposed to give you a techno-feel. Most 3D models in this game are platonic solids or shapes that can be rigged in less than 3 steps in Blender.</description></item><item><title>Box, Hop!

&amp;ldquo;Box, Hop! Box&amp;rdquo; is a game where the objective is to keep climbing while avoiding the edges of the screen and falling boxes.
I originally made this for js13k for which the theme was reversal. Hence, the flipping controller. I messed up the final submission and the result is that it only works in browsers that support a few ES6 features. The version on this site works fine though.</description></item><item><title>Glitchball</title><link>https://www.varav.in/games/glitchball/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.varav.in/games/glitchball/</guid><description>Play Rules There are two players and the aim of this game is to get the ball (yellow thing) to the other players goal.
Once you have the ball, if the other player touches you, you die and respawn next to your goal and the other player gets possesion of the ball.
When the attacking player glitches, the defending player is frozen and the attacking player can move like they normally do.</description></item></channel></rss>
