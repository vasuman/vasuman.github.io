<p>I was watching the <a href="http://firstlifeseries.com/">First Life</a> documentary which
chronicles the origins and evolution of life. In the documentary, they make a
mention of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charnia">Charnia</a> a frond-like
primitive organism. It lived deep underwater and fed of nutrients in the water.
Sadly, it went extinct and has no extant descendants. Since it is one of the
oldest known multicellular organisms it provides great insights into the origins
of such beings.</p>
<p>This is what they supposedly looked like,</p>
<p><figure><img alt="Charnia" src="/static/images/lsystem/charnia.jpg" /><figcaption>Charnia</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Now, you may be wondering why I’m talking about something that hasn’t been
around for over 500 million years. Well, I was struck by the beauty and
simplicity of the organization of it’s cells. These organisms adopted fractal
branching to generate their body structure.</p>
<p>Since this organism had to absorb its sustenance from the ocean, it needed a
very high surface area and compact packing. Fractal arrangements were perfect
for this. It’s truly amazing how resourceful these organisms were to use
relatively simple instructions can give rise to amazingly beautiful patterns.
They necessarily couldn’t be too elaborate in their designs.</p>
<h2 id="lindenmayer-systems">Lindenmayer systems</h2>
<p>Digging deeper into this topic is where I found
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">Lindenmayer Systems</a> or L-systems for
short. Developed by Astrid Lindenmayer, a Hungarian biologist in 1968, they
provide a clear and simple way to model fractal growth.</p>
<p>An L-system is basically a type of formal grammar, in other words, it defines a
language – basically a set of acceptable strings. It has three basic
components,</p>
<ol>
<li>Set of alphabets used to compose the strings</li>
<li>An axiom (<em>starting string</em>)</li>
<li>Rewrite rules</li>
</ol>
<p>The set of strings belonging to this language is generated by first starting out
with a set containing the axiom. Then we generate new strings by applying all
applicable rewrite rules to the strings in the set.</p>
<p>Rewrite rules or production rules as you may have heard of them consist of a
<em>left-hand</em> side and a <em>right-hand</em> side. Any substring matching the left side
can be substituted with the string on the right side. As with any formal
grammar, an L-system is context-free if there is only a single symbol in the
left hand side of the production.</p>
<p>L-system models are greatly suited to generate self-similar or <em>fractal</em>
patterns because the rewrite rules can be recursively expanded.</p>
<h2 id="logo">Logo</h2>
<p>I remember back in school when we were first introduced to computers and
programming, we were taught the
<a href="http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/logo/programming.html">Logo Programming Language</a>.
I thought this was just one of those things you were taught in school and never
had to use later. Well, turns out I was wrong, the little turtle wasn’t dead
yet. Most L-systems use a Logo-like paradigm to implement graphics.</p>
<p>In a relatively simple model, the turtle’s state encapsulates of four
parameters,</p>
<ol>
<li><code>x</code> co-ordinate.</li>
<li><code>y</code> co-ordinate.</li>
<li>Angle of orientation</li>
<li>Color of line drawn.</li>
</ol>
<p>Stateful drawing commands help us generate graphics for every derived string.
Each symbol is associated with a Logo command and every string is interpreted as
a sequence of commands that is executed by the interpreter to generate the final
pattern.</p>
<h2 id="mechanism">Mechanism</h2>
<p>Consider, a relatively simple grammar.</p>
<p>The set of symbols is, <code>{A, B, C, R}</code></p>
<p>Production rules are,</p>
<pre><code>A : A B A C A B A
</code></pre><p>Now, I must mention here that for any symbol (<code>X</code>) lacking any rewrite rule, we
assume an identity expansion, i.e.</p>
<pre><code>X : X
</code></pre><p>The axiom is <code>R A</code>. The <code>R</code> symbol is just used to get the orientation correct.</p>
<p>Consider these draw rules for the symbols,</p>
<pre><code>A = FD 10
B = RT 60
C = LT 120
R = RT 90
</code></pre><p>Initially, the string representing the state of the system is,</p>
<pre><code>R A
</code></pre><p>Substituting the symbols’ logo equivalents we get the sequence,</p>
<pre><code>RT 90
FD 10
</code></pre><p>The graphical representation of the system looks like,</p>
<p><figure><img alt="Initial state" src="/static/images/lsystem/lsys-init.jpg" /><figcaption>Initial state</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>On iterating once, we apply the production to expand all the symbols we can. Our
string becomes,</p>
<pre><code>R A B A C A B A
</code></pre><p>Logo sequence equivalent,</p>
<pre><code>RT 90
FD 10
RT 60
FD 10
LT 120
FD 10
RT 60
FD 10
</code></pre><p>Evaluating these commands in an interpreter, we get the graphical
representation,</p>
<p><figure><img alt="First iteration" src="/static/images/lsystem/lsys-1.jpg" /><figcaption>First iteration</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Iterating again, we continue to expand and our string becomes,</p>
<pre><code>R A B A C B A B A B A C B A C A B A C B A B A B A C B A
</code></pre><p>OK, that’s big. As you may have probably guessed, the string size grows
exponentially.</p>
<p>It looks like,</p>
<p><figure><img alt="Second iteration" src="/static/images/lsystem/lsys-2.jpg" /><figcaption>Second iteration</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>If you look at what this system is actually doing in simple terms, it’s simply
replacing every straight line in the figure with a small triangular bump. This
substitution is recursively applied to any lines in the resulting figure to give
rise to self-similarity.</p>
<p>Another iteration and we get something looking like this,</p>
<p><figure><img alt="Third iteration" src="/static/images/lsystem/lsys-3.jpg" /><figcaption>Third iteration</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Pretty cool, right!</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="/demos/lsystem.html">demo</a> that I wrote up. It has got a few cool
presets. The <a href="https://github.com/vasuman/lsystem">source code</a> also is
available.</p>

<p>Here’s a few cool patterns that I’ve generated.</p>
