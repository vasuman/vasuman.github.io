                    <p>We conventionally associate the term logic with bivalent logic. A system in
which any proposition is assigned just one of two possible values: true or
false. But, what if there was more to it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most certain of all basic principles is that contradictory propositions
are not true simultaneously.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This principle laid out in Aristotle’s Metaphysics, called the law of
noncontradiction, is a fundamental axiom of classical logic. Aligned with our
intuitive understanding of semantics, this law also seems to have been
accepted as indisputable canon in various schools of formal logic. Reflected
in the Persian polymath Ibn Sina’s rather brutal condemnation of anyone who
didn’t subscribe to this law.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyone who denies the law of noncontradiction should be beaten and burned
until he admits that to be beaten is not the same as not to be beaten, and to
be burned is not the same as not to be burned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from the intuitive rationale, the formal basis for the law of
noncontradiction lies in the principle of explosion. This principle states
that in a system where a statement and its negation are both true, we can
prove the truth of any arbitrary statement. In other words, from
contradiction, anything follows (<em>ex contradictione sequitur quodlibet</em>).</p>
<p>Consider the case where proposition (A), “all apples are red” and its
negation (¬A), “not all apples are red” are both true. We take an arbitrary
proposition (B), “aliens exist”, and perform a logical or (A | B), “all
apples are red OR aliens exist”. But since we know that “not apples are not
red” (¬A), we can prove that “aliens exist” (B). We could use a similar
structure to prove that “aliens don’t exist” (¬B).</p>
<p>A system in which every statement and its negation can be proved true, is
clearly not very useful for anything practical. But, what if a system with a
contradiction didn’t collapse into absurdity? A system of logic that can
accommodate contradictions without exploding into triviality is called a
paraconsistent logic.</p>
<p>For inspiration as to what such a logic would look like, we can examine the
principles of the various schools of Indian logic that didn’t subscribe to
the law of noncontradiction.</p>
<p>In classical logic, any conclusion can be implied from any premise as long as
their truth values match up — like a premise about apples implying a
conclusion about aliens. But, many Hindu logicians emphasized the principle
of pervasion (<em>vyāpti</em>), which required a strong universal correlation
(<em>sahacāra</em>) between the reason (<em>hetu</em>) and conclusion (<em>sādhya</em>) when
performing an implication.</p>
<p>This restricts the range of inferences we can make from a proposition,
limiting the “blast radius” of a contradiction. In the above example about
apples and aliens, we would only be able to make the implication about the
existence of aliens if we had prior knowledge of a commonality or relation
between the color of apples and the existence of aliens.</p>
<p>This type of logic is known in contemporary philosophy as a relevance logic.
A relevance logic limits the application of the material implication
connective (→) to cases where the premise and conclusion share some common
characteristics.</p>
<p>In other words, they force your inferences to “stay on topic”. Depending on
the exact system of logic, this could mean requiring the same propositional
variable be present in the premise and conclusion, or some other kind of
ternary relation constraining the use of the implication.</p>
<p>In addition to preventing a contradiction from exploding, relevance logics
also solve the problem of vacuous truths. A vacuous truth is a conditional
statement that is always true because the premise itself is false.</p>
<p>For example, the conditional statement, “if the earth is flat then I’m a
millionaire”, is always true regardless of my financial situation, because
the earth simply isn’t flat. Requiring a strong connection between the
premise and conclusion would prevent such pointless statements from being
valid.</p>
<p>For different kind of paraconsistent treatment, we can look to the Buddhist
schools of logic. In their analyses of propositions, Buddhist logicians
frequently employed a fourfold structure (<em>catuṣkoṭi</em>). For every proposition
(P) they considered four possibilities.</p>
<ol>
<li>P </li>
<li>not P </li>
<li>P and (not P) </li>
<li>neither P nor (not P)</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to doing away with the exclusivity of truth values — allowing a
proposition to be true and false — they also did away with the law of the
excluded middle — allowing a proposition to be neither. Far from being some
sort of mystical riddle, this is a
<a href="https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/comparativephilosophy/vol1/iss2/6/">valid</a>
system of logic — known in modern terms as a many-valued logic.</p>
<p>First Degree Entailment (FDE) is an example of one such system in modern
logic which has four truth values: true, false, both and neither. In addition
to the traditional true and false values, FDE also accounts for truth value
gluts (both) and truth value gaps (neither).</p>
<p>The truth tables of this logic also lay down the rules for operating on these
values in a standard way. For example, the negation of a proposition that is
both true and false is the same as the original proposition, which is
verifiable by applying De Morgan’s law.</p>
<p>So, anyways, what is the point of these logics?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This statement is false.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The liar’s paradox is an example of a true contradiction. Belonging to the
broader class of self-reference paradoxes, these types of statements resist a
rigid assignment to simple true or false values. Since if it were true, it
would also be false, and vice versa. While it is hard to represent this in
classical logic, in a many-valued logic, we have the ability to assign this
statement the “both true and false” value.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the goal of a paraconsistent logic is not to
help resolve a paradox one way or another. It is to allow for them to exist
in a structured way that doesn’t completely obliterate everything else that
is useful about logical reasoning.</p>
<p>If you’re still reading this, it means your brain didn’t immediately explode
upon encountering a paradoxical sentence. If our minds can handle paradoxes
without blowing up, why shouldn’t our systems of logic display a similar kind
of resilience?</p>
<p>These logics also have an application in automated reasoning. Real world
datasets can be notoriously unreliable. Either due to human error,
adversarial exploits, or just the messiness of the problem space. Using a
paraconsistent system allows for much more robustness when reasoning with
inconsistent or incomplete information.</p>
<p>Another possible application is in the field of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01889304">quantum
logic</a>. In quantum
computing, a qubit exists in a superposition of states that is a kind of
probabilistic combination of true and false values — similar to the case in
paraconsistent logic.</p>
<p>A common criticism of paraconsistent logic is that there is no ontological basis
for a contradictory statement in reality as we know it. That’s fair, but the
same argument could be made for negative or complex numbers — I have never
seen anyone eat exactly <em>-3i</em> apples. Nevertheless, such abstractions are
still useful in modelling certain scenarios and do have real-world
applications.</p>
<p>Scientific progress is built on paradigm shifts that challenge our intuitive
notions of how things should be. The discovery of infinitesimal calculus was
crucial to subsequent models of classical physics. Just like the development
of non-euclidean geometry was to understanding the theory of general
relativity. Perhaps unlocking the next wave of progress requires us to shed
the orthodoxy of strictly exclusivecategories of truth and falsity.</p>
