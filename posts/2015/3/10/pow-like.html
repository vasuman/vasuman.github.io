            <h3>Proof-of-like</h3>

        <p>Not surprisingly, I spend most of my free time browsing the
inter-webs. I come across a lot of things that I <em>like</em>. But as a
random stranger it is hard to convey that sentiment in a convenient
yet meaningful way.</p>
<p>To be fair, most sites integrate the Facebook Likeâ„¢ button or
something in that vein. But my major qualm with these systems is that
they require you to <strong>log in</strong>, tying your entire online identity to
the act of liking. You basically broadcast your interests to the
entire world and allow these companies to build a profile of your
interests.</p>
<p>This got me thinking as to whether there is a way for somebody to like
something <strong>anonymously</strong> on the Internet. The biggest problem that came
to mind was <em>spam</em>. Of all the anti-spam methods out there the one I
found most innovative was <a href="#">Hashcash</a>. Which brings me to
<a href="#">proof-of-work systems</a></p>
<h2>Proof-of-work</h2>
<p>Proof-of-work systems have been around for a while now. The basic
principle is that, there is a class of problems for which it is hard
to find a solution. Though, once a solution is found, verifying that
it is valid is relatively easy. There is a fundamental <strong>asymmetry</strong> in
the computational power required between finding and verifying a
solution to such problems. This characteristic is exploited to build
systems in which one party can trivially ensure the another party has
-- within limits; expended some amount of computational resource (CPU
or memory).</p>
<p>Consider the problem of finding a suitable nonce value (\(n\)) such
that when appended to some challenge string (\(C\)) and hashed the
resulting hash value meets some constraint -- like being lesser than a
given target value (\(T_V\)).</p>
<p>$$ H( C||n ) &lt; T_V $$</p>
<p>Since hashing is a one-way function, it is practically impossible --
infeasible is a better word; to deduce the value of \(n\) from
\(C\), therefore the only way to find a value for \(n\) is to
<a href="#">brute-force</a> the search space, performing a large number of
computations -- depending on the difficulty of satisfying the
constraint. Once a suitable value of \(n\) is found, a verifier
needs to perform the hash function <em>exactly once</em> to check that the
resulting hash matches the presented constraint.</p>
<p>Hashcash -- one of the first widely implemented proof-of-work systems;
was used to combat email spam and prevent denial-of-service
attacks. Nowadays though, thanks to <a href="#">Bitcoin</a>, proof-of-work
systems have a much larger audience.</p>
<h2>HashLike</h2>
<p>HashLike is a system that uses proof-of-work to allow people to
anonymously like things on the internet.</p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>Simply put, there are 5 basic steps,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Client requests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server sends a challenge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Client begins brute-force search</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Client finds nonce</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Client sends nonce to server</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Additional benefits</h3>
<h4>Parametric liking</h4>
<p>Suppose you've got two pictures of kittens in front of me,</p>
<p><img alt="Kitteh 1" src="#" /></p>
<p><img alt="Kitteh 2" src="#" /></p>
<p>With HashLike I can actually like one picture more than the other.</p>
<h4>Actual resource</h4>
<p>HashLikes represent some reaThis is more of a symbolic benefit.</p>
