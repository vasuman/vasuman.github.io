        <p>Not surprisingly, I spend most of my free time browsing the
inter-webs. I come across a lot of things that I <em>like</em>. But as a
random stranger it is hard to convey that sentiment in a convenient
yet meaningful way.</p>
<p>To be fair, most sites integrate the Facebook Like button or something
in that vein. But my major qualm with these systems is that they
require you to <strong>log in</strong>, tying your entire online identity to the
act of liking. You basically broadcast your interests to the entire
world. Also, these buttons are more about sharing content with your
peers on social networks.</p>
<p>This got me thinking as to whether there is a way for somebody to like
something <strong>anonymously</strong> on the Internet. The biggest problem that
came to mind was <em>spam</em> -- what is to stop somebody from abusing the
system? Now, of all the spam combating methods out there the one I
found most innovative was <a href="http://www.hashcash.org/">Hashcash</a>. And so, I went about
approaching the problem with that in mind. This brings me to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system">proof-of-work systems</a>.</p>
<h2>Proof-of-work</h2>
<p>Proof-of-work systems have been around for a while now. The basic
principle is that, there is a class of problems for which it is hard
to find a solution. Though, once a solution is found, verifying that
it is valid is relatively easy. There is a fundamental <strong>asymmetry</strong> in
the computational power required between finding and verifying a
solution to such problems. This characteristic is exploited to build
systems in which one party can trivially ensure the another party has
-- within limits; expended some amount of computational resource (CPU
or memory).</p>
<p>Consider the problem of finding a suitable nonce value (\(n\)) such
that when appended to some challenge string (\(C\)) and hashed the
resulting hash value meets some constraint -- like being lesser than a
given target value (\(T_V\)).</p>
<p>$$ H( C||n ) &lt; T_V $$</p>
<p>Since hashing is a one-way function, it is practically impossible --
infeasible is a better word; to deduce the value of \(n\) from
\(C\), therefore the only way to find a value for \(n\) is to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute force</a> the search space, performing a large number of
computations -- depending on the difficulty of satisfying the
constraint. Once a suitable value of \(n\) is found, a verifier
needs to perform the hash function <em>exactly once</em> to check that the
resulting hash matches the presented constraint.</p>
<p>Hashcash -- one of the first widely implemented proof-of-work systems;
was used to combat email spam and prevent denial-of-service
attacks. Nowadays though, thanks to <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a>, proof-of-work
systems have a much larger audience.</p>
<hr />
<p>Outlining how a system for liking using proof-of-work functions,</p>
<h2>Steps Involved</h2>
<p>We have a <em>client</em> and <em>server</em>. Simply put, there are 5 basic steps,</p>
<p><strong>Client sends requests</strong>, indicating that it wishes to like. This
step is probably initiated by some form of user interaction. This
interaction should also allow the user to modify a parameter
indicating <em>how much</em> he likes the thing.</p>
<p><strong>Server generates a challenge</strong> and sends it to the client. The
<code>challenge</code> generated is probably a function of the user's IP, a
timestamp and of course, the URL of the page he likes. The generated
<code>challenge</code> is stored in a cache and marked with an <code>expiry</code> timestamp
after which, it gets flushed -- a client must submit solution before
this.</p>
<p><strong>Client begins work</strong>. It performs an exhaustive brute-force search
on the entire search space. The user probably has to stay on the page
for the duration of this search -- switching causes a demotion of
priority and makes the search extremely slow.</p>
<p>Once, <strong>the client finds a suitable nonce</strong>, that satisfies the
supplied constraint, it sends the value to the server tagged with the
<code>challenge</code> that it solved.</p>
<p><strong>Server verifies the nonce</strong> and assigns a <code>reward</code> value depending
on the <code>difficulty</code> of a solution.</p>
<h2>Issues</h2>
<h3>Environment</h3>
<p>All of the client side code has to <strong>run in the browser</strong>. An
important here consideration is that, while the client is working, it
shouldn't hinder the user's interaction with the rest of the page. The
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">Web Worker API</a> is ideally suited for this, since it
allows for a script to run without blocking the main UI thread on the
page.</p>
<h3>Speed</h3>
<p>Running in the browser limits our ability to exploit the full CPU
potential. And accessing the GPU from the browser requires the use of
WebGL. The problem is that the WebGL context can only be accessed from
the main UI thread.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten">Emscripten</a> shows some impressive performance
benchmarks. Hell, they've even gotten
<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/03/12/mozilla-and-epic-preview-unreal-engine-4-running-in-firefox/">Unreal Engine to run in the browser!</a></p>
<h3>Content vs. URL</h3>
<p>At first, I thought that it would be better to base the challenge on
the <strong>content</strong> of the page. The advantage of this is that it provides
some kind of authentication -- if the content of the page is changed
in any way, all previous likes become invalid. The problem with that
approach is that even minor edits can change the generated <code>challenge</code>
-- something to avoid.</p>
<h2>Pluses</h2>
<h3>Parametric liking</h3>
<p>Say I've got two <em>articles</em> of in front of me.</p>
<p>Now, I definitely like one but I think the other is <em>way</em> better.
Earlier, my likes in both cases were worth the same! But now, I can
actually like one more than the other.</p>
<p><strong>How?</strong>, you may ask. Well, most proof-of-work functions have an
adjustable <code>difficulty</code> parameter. The <em>higher</em> the value of this
parameter, the <em>longer</em> it takes to find a nonce value that satisfies
the solution, but it generates a higher <code>reward</code> value.</p>
<p>So, for something that I casually like, I can set a lower <code>difficulty</code>
value. But, for something that I think is <em>really great</em> I can set a
higher <code>difficulty</code> value.</p>
<h3>Actual resource</h3>
<p>This is really more of a symbolic benefit. Since liking is backed by a
solution to a proof-of-work function, it can be safely assumed that
the <em>liker</em> has expended some <em>real</em> amount of computational power in
generating the nonce.</p>
<h2>Not so pluses</h2>
<h3>Mobile</h3>
<p>This idea doesn't really play well with mobile devices for two main
reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>CPU</strong> - It will take quite a while longer to like something.</li>
<li><strong>Power</strong> - Liking frequently significantly drains the battery.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Undemocratic</h3>
<p>In this system, not everybody is equally represented. A higher
weightage is given to people that have more compute power. People who
can afford more powerful systems end up having more <em>liking power</em>
than the others. </p>
<h3>Page focus</h3>
<p>To perform the like, the <em>liker</em> must keep the page in
focus. Otherwise, the brute-force job gets demoted to a background
task and eventually it times out.</p>

-- written in Golang. Check out <a href="#not-setup-yet">this page</a> and the
