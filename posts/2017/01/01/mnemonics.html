                    <p>Breaking from my ususal pattern of posting about programming, I thought I’d
write about (cue dramatic music) <strong>the hidden powers of the mind</strong>.</p>
<p>A friend recently recommended this book called <a href="http://joshuafoer.com/moonwalking-with-einstein/">Moonwalking with Einstein</a> by
Joshua Foer that dives into the world of competitive memorization. <a href="http://www.world-memory-statistics.com/disciplines.php">Records</a>
set in such contests include remembering and recalling 520 digits in sequence
in a 5-minute period and the order of 1626 playing cards in an hour. Certainly,
the contestants must be freaks of nature blessed with a photographic memory.
Sorry to burst your bubble, but contrary to what popular media would have you
believe, <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2006/04/kaavya_syndrome.single.html">it’s higly unlikely</a> that anybody has such abilities.</p>
<p>Then, what enables these people to perform such amazing feats of memory when I
struggle to remember what I had for breakfast yesterday (it was Dosa, I think).
Well, it turns out that you can accomplish pretty amazing things with just an
average memory using the right techniques.</p>
<p>While most memory competitions include a variety of tasks (names and faces,
playing cards and even poerty), for the rest of this post I’m going to focus
specifically on the task of remebering long strings of digits in sequence. But,
the general idea that I wish to convey is that there are methods to make
seemingly impossible memorization tasks into tractable problems.</p>
<h2 id="chunking">Chunking</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)">Chunking</a> is a psychological process that assists the human mind in storing
and retrieving information. It works by grouping individual pieces of
information into larger units that can be remembered and recalled together. This
helps by effectively reducing the <em>unique items</em> that your mind need to
remember. You may notice this happen subconciously when trying to memorize a
telephone number, you generally split the number by grouping its component
digits into semantically meaningful parts, like the country code, STD code, area
code, etc. And then remebering these parts individually.</p>
<h2 id="major-system">Major system</h2>
<p>The Major system is a method that helps convert digits into consonant sounds in
which each <strong>digit</strong> maps to one or more <strong>sounds</strong>.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Digit</th>
<th align="right">Sound</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>1</td>
<td align="right">2</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>I used <a href="http://www.memrise.com/course/43909/the-mnemonic-major-system/">this deck</a> from the Memrise app (which is pretty nicely gamified, by
the way) to help me learn the sound to number associations and vice-versa. I
skipped the word lists for reasons which I explain in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="story-method">Story method</h2>
<p>Also called the <a href="http://mt.artofmemory.com/wiki/Mnemonic_Link_System">mnemonic link system</a>, using the major system, we can
convert a string of digits into a sequence of phonemes. To remember the digits
simply make a story out of the sounds. Suppose, you have the number 1523776</p>
<h2 id="person-object-action-system">Person-Object-Action system</h2>
<p>The Person-Object-Action (POA) system associates each <code>n</code>-digit number with a
<em>person</em> performing an <em>action</em> with an <em>object</em>. The <code>n</code> here is the chunk
size (usually 2 or 3).</p>
<h2 id="method-of-loci">Method of loci</h2>
<p>Method of loci.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>My main takeaway from this exercise was how specific mental representations can
help overcome cognitive limits.</p>
