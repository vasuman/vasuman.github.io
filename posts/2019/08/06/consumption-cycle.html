                    <p>Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’re probably aware of the recent
decluttering frenzy, fueled by the popularity of Marie Kondo’s new
Netflix <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80209379">show</a>. As a slightly compulsive
neat freak, I wholeheartedly bought into the premise that you should only hold
on to things that trigger happiness. And while the “if it doesn’t spark joy, get
rid of it” mantra seems like sound advice at face value, it also has the
potential to trigger a vicious circle of overconsumption.</p>
<p>It all started with one of the semi-periodic purges of things that I own when I
vaguely recalled trying to get rid of the exact same item before. I was just
about to dismiss it as plain-old déjà vu when I got a little curious.</p>
<p>Being your stereotypical 20-something lazy millennial, I do most of my shopping
online. And one of the few advantages of living in a world where giant
corporations constantly track every move you make online with the sole purpose
of relentlessly maximizing their profits is that they sometimes let you take a
peek. So, I scoured through my unexpectedly long online order history and there
it was!</p>
<p>It wasn’t a hallucination, I actually ordered the same item twice. And although
the purchases were months apart, it made me feel enough remorse to start
thinking about my consumption patterns more deeply. Was I mindlessly throwing
away things which eventually led me to buy more to replace the stuff that I got
rid of in the first place?</p>
<p>Aside from the financial prudence in reducing my overall consumption, there’s
also the moral responsibility to mitigate my environmental impact, especially
given
the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/national-overview-facts-and-figures-materials">low</a> solid
waste recycling rates.</p>
<h2 id="sparking-joy">Sparking Joy</h2>
<p>To start off, I had to figure out how I valued things when choosing to discard
them. On careful analysis, I found that my instinctive value judgment of a thing
is broadly based on a couple of factors.</p>
<p>First, there is the <em>instrumental value</em> based on the utility or purpose that a
thing is meant for. Then, there is the <em>novelty value</em> that I ascribe to a thing
by virtue of its newness. Finally, there’s the <em>sentimental value</em> that a thing
possesses through a personal association with my experiences.</p>
<p>The relative weights of these factors would also vary for different categories
of things. For ornamental things (clothes, accessories, etc.), I give more
importance to novelty over sentimental value. Maybe because what I was wearing
isn’t a salient fact in my recollection of experiences, unless someone
compliments my look — which is rare given my fashion sense.</p>
<p>Given a fixed set of circumstances, the instrumental value of a thing stays
constant. Novelty, however, tends to fade off over time, which makes me more
likely to discard of older things.</p>
<p>Novelty also seemed to recover slightly, if I hadn’t encountered the item for a
while, although never completely back up to its initial levels. One strategy I
found to maximize the net lifespan of my clothes was to rotate through smaller
sets of clothes over a longer cycle. The <em>rest period</em> helped them regain some
of their novelty in my eyes.</p>
<p>To compensate for the fall in novelty, I could also increase sentimental
attachment to a thing through personalization. Laptop stickers are a great way
to reduce your urge to upgrade your machine. The more you make something feel
unique, the lesser you want to part with it.</p>
<h2 id="maximal-minimalism">Maximal Minimalism</h2>
<p>Since we’re on the topic of decluttering and consumption, I’d also like to
highlight some other ironies of the modern minimalism movement. Extreme versions
of minimalism can force you to possess an <em>unrealistically low</em> number of things
can actually lead to increased consumption.</p>
<p>While traveling, I once met someone who claimed to have backpacked across
Southeast Asia for months with nothing more than a medium-sized bag. I was
really impressed by their resourcefulness until they casually mentioned that
they would simply buy, use and dispose of things because they were so cheap.
Dude, that’s cheating!</p>
<p>I was also forced to consider whether the pursuit of minimalism was in some
ways, an <em>exercise in privilege</em>. It’s only when you’re absolutely certain that
you can easily re-acquire a similar thing, that you’re willing to get rid of it
without much deliberation. I felt bad for harshly judging grandmother for
hoarding piles of stuff that she rarely ever used. Maybe her habits were shaped
by the circumstances of scarcity that she grew up in.</p>
<p>There’s also a difference between “minimalism as a principle” and “minimalism as
an aesthetic”. The principle prescribes that you only own as many things as you
need — no more, no less. The aesthetic, however, entails a subjective assessment
of beauty based on higher-level visual features. These two things can often be
at odds.</p>
<p>In a lot of content promoting the minimalist aesthetic, there is this latent
assumption that a more ideal version of an already functioning thing that you
own exists. The monochrome ceramic pot may have fewer surface irregularities
than the chaffed up plastic one that the plant came in. But by purchasing it,
you now have one more additional thing than you need to.</p>
<p>Everybody’s life is different and you are the best judge of your own. The next
time you’re replacing or getting rid of something, think about what is driving
your behavior. Are you genuinely certain that the item no longer serves its
intended purpose or are you trying to conform to somebody else’s curated vision
of what an ideal lifestyle should look like?</p>
