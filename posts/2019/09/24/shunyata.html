                    <p>For millennia, philosophers have debated whether essences (<em>svabhāva</em>) are real
entities. In the West, the essentialist doctrine was famously espoused by
Plato’s Theory of Ideas which claimed that real-world objects are imitations of
transcendent Forms.</p>
<p>In his book <a href="http://www.ntslibrary.com/PDF%20Books/History%20of%20Western%20Philosophy.pdf#page=217">The History of Western
Philosophy</a>,
Bertrand Russell criticizes this view, claiming that it conflates a linguistic
convention with metaphysical ontology.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We apply the same name, on different occasions, to somewhat different
occurrences, which we regard as manifestations of a single “thing” or “person”.
In fact, however, this is only a verbal convenience. […] The question is purely
linguistic: a word may have an essence, but a thing cannot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The debate in the Indian subcontinent, however, was not focused on the
substantiveness of physical things, but the true nature of phenomenal
experiences.</p>
<p>It centered around whether the fundamental constituents of experience
(<em>dharma</em>) like consciousness (<em>citta</em>), thoughts (<em>cetasika</em>) and physical
forms (<em>rūpa</em>); were real entities or just useful — but ultimately fictitious —
conceptual constructs.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the essentialist camp, there were the aptronymic Sarvastivadins, an early
Buddhist sect that thrived around the Kashmir valley. They claimed all
elementary dharmas exist (<em>sarvām-asti</em>) substantively (<em>dravya</em>)<em>, _as opposed
to chariots
and <a href="https://www.utne.com/mind-and-body/ship-of-theseus-identity-ze0z1311zjhar">ships</a> which
only have a nominal existence (_prajñapti</em>).</p>
<p>In this context, the term dharmas refer to the irreducible atoms of phenomenal
experience in a discrete moment (<em>kṣaṇa</em>) of awareness. Each dharma possesses a
unique property (<em>svālakṣaṇa</em>) that characterizes it: fire is hot, water is
wet.</p>
<p>Sarvastivadins also held that dharmas_ <em>were eternal and unchanging,
permanently existing in all periods: past, present, and future. But only
dharmas in the present time had productive effects (_kārita</em>).</p>
<p>Opposing this view, was Nagarjuna, a monk from South India who is probably one
of the most important Buddhist philosophers: perhaps more than the Buddha
himself, who was a pragmatist concerned with ending suffering and less prone to
engaging in dialectical reasoning.</p>
<p>Along with his pupil Aryadeva, Nagarjuna founded the centrist Madhyamaka school
which sought to find a middle path between the extremes of essentialism and
nihilism. Their answer was to claim that all dharmas are empty (<em>śūnya</em>) of any
intrinsic nature and also that the apparent emptiness is empty itself.</p>
<hr>
<p>Nagarjuna’s magnum opus <a href="https://www2.hf.uio.no/polyglotta/index.php?page=volume&amp;vid=27">Root Verses on the Middle
Way</a> (<em>mūlamadhyamakakārikā</em>,
or MMK for short) is a collection of apophatic assertions about the nature of
reality in verse form. If you’re looking for a good commentary, I’d highly
recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1614290504">this one</a> by Siderits and
Katsura.</p>
<p>To the uninitiated, the extensive use of <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> dialogue to
deny the ultimate truth of any concept can seem frustrating. But, the aim isn’t
to engage in a
destructive <a href="https://medium.com/@vasuman/lessonson-debates-from-an-ancient-manual-81b437525f0f">debate</a> (<em>vitaṇḍā-vada</em>),
it is to point out that language itself implicitly relies on an unsubstantiated
notion of essence.</p>
<p>Tsongkhapa of the Tibetan Gelug
school <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236700328_The_Svatantrika-Prasangika_Distinction_What_Difference_Does_a_Difference_Make_review">emphasized</a> this meta distinction
in viewpoints of the interlocutors. By laying out the absurd consequences
(<em>prasaṅgika</em>) of all forms of syllogistic reasoning, they covertly hinted at a
foundational flaw in the opponent’s world view.</p>
<hr>
<p>Nagarjuna was very thorough in his construction of arguments. This is
highlighted by his use of the tetralemma (<em>catuṣkoṭi</em>): a fourfold argument.
For a pair of propositions (A, B), we consider all four possibilities.</p>
<ol>
<li>A and (not B)</li>
<li>(not A) and B</li>
<li>A and B</li>
<li>(not A) and (not B)</li>
</ol>
<p>This structure is employed when discussing the origination of conditioned
dharmas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>na svato nāpi parato na dvābhyāṃ nāpyahetutaḥ utpannā jātu vidyante bhāvāḥ
kva cana ke cana</p>
<p>No thing anywhere is ever originated from itself, from something else, from
both or without a cause. (MMK 1.1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The commentaries elaborate that if the conditions contained the essence of the
effect they produced (<em>satkaryavada</em>), there would be no need for a distinct
act of origination.</p>
<p>If a thing borrows its essence from something else (<em>asatkaryavada</em>), where
does the “other” thing derive its essence from? We end up with an infinite web
of dependency relationships.</p>
<p>The conjunction of these propositions is denied because neither one can be
independently established. And the final case leads to the absurdity of having
no restrictions on how things come to be.</p>
<hr>
<p>Central to Buddhist dogma was the concept of dependent
origination (<em>pratītyasamutpāda</em>): all dharmas arise dependent on other
dharmas. Unlike mental abstractions, real things don’t exist in isolation.</p>
<p>If the existence of a thing depends on something else, it is empty of an
intrinsic essence, because essences are supposed to be independent and
immutable.</p>
<p>This applies not only to entities but also their properties or attributes.
Properties can only be ascribed when a thing is compared to other things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>yaḥ pratītyasamutpādaḥ śūnyatāṃ tāṃ pracakṣmahe sā prajñaptir upādāya
pratipat saiva madhyamā</p>
<p>Whatever is contingently related, that is explained as emptiness. That is
contingently designated; it is the central path. (MMK 24.18)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The property of size is one such example. The size of a thing — like a banana —
can only be described in terms of its relation to the size of another object.
Even the standardized units that we conventionally use are just a useful common
reference and subject
to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_metre">change</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Seeds of the Madhyamika thesis are also found in the canonical Buddhist concept
of impermanence (<em>aniccā</em>) which is one of the three marks of existence.
Constant change is an undeniable characteristic of reality, but the way we
refer to things only considers a static snapshot of the state of the world.</p>
<p>In
his <a href="http://www.epitropakisg.gr/grigorise/Mayr_GrowthOfBiologicalThought.pdf#page=163">book</a>,
Ernst Mayr discusses the role that essentialist taxonomy played in shackling
pre-Darwinian biological thought. From the time of Aristotle, biologists
believed that all animals had fixed essences based on the species they belonged
to: all people had a human essence.</p>
<p>But, the theory of evolution shows that incremental mutations and changing
environmental selection pressures make successive generations diverge
genetically from their ancestors. So, the definition of what it means to be
“human” is in constant flux.</p>
<hr>
<p>The concept of emptiness can easily be misconstrued and inappropriately applied
to strip anything of meaning: including the precepts of Buddhism. One could
potentially justify immoral and unethical actions, by claiming that all
things — including karmic consequences — were empty. To defend against this,
Nagarjuna employed the famous two truths theory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>dve satye samupāśritya buddhānāṃ dharmadeśanā lokasaṃvṛtisatyaṃ ca satyaṃ ca
paramārthataḥ</p>
<p>The Dharma taught by Buddhas perfectly relies on two truths: the worldly
conventional truth and the ultimate truth. (MMK 24.10)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The conventional truth (<em>saṁvṛti-satya</em>) deals with the truths of the world
that we inhabit. Causation, physical laws of the universe and facts about our
lives fall into this category. Emptiness described the ultimate truth
(<em>paramārtha-satya</em>) which was unconditioned and free of any characteristic
attributes.</p>
<p>According to Nagarjuna, practical knowledge was vital to spiritual progress.
And one had to understand the distinction between these truths to truly
comprehend emptiness.</p>
<hr>
<p>Orthodox Hindu philosophers, who sought to establish a metaphysical absolute
(<em>brahman</em>) as the source of all essence, often attacked the Madhyamaka
position as being nihilistic.</p>
<p>In defense, the commentator Chandrakriti claims that they are imposing a
negative spin on the concept of emptiness. The emptiness that the Madhyamikas
describe is not an assertion of non-existence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>śūnyam iti na vaktavyam aśūnyam iti vā bhavet ubhayaṃ nobhayaṃ ceti
prajñaptyarthaṃ tu kathyate</p>
<p>Empty should not be asserted. Non-empty should not be asserted.  Neither both
nor neither should be asserted. They are only used nominally. (MMK 22.11)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The essentialist believes that the emptiness being described is a concrete
characteristic of the ultimate reality, but the emptiness referred to
is reflexively empty itself. The choice of the word “empty” is just a matter of
convenience and doesn’t hold any innate essence itself.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Nagarjuna refused to defend emptiness as a standalone
metaphysical view. Since any such defense would invariably assert emptiness as
an intrinsic property of reality. His goal was to end all metaphysical
speculation, not replace one distorted view with another.</p>
<p>This is also why there is no “master argument” that establishes emptiness. An
argument for emptiness can only be made in response to a flawed essentialist
position.</p>
<hr>
<p>The soteriological purpose of this philosophy was to aid in the attainment of
nirvana by ending conceptual proliferation (<em>prapañca-nirodha</em>). According to
Buddhism, concepts are imprecise and cannot reflect the ultimate nature of
reality: which is unconditioned (<em>asankhata</em>) and only realized through direct
experience.</p>
<p>It’s also important to contextualize this work. Nagarjuna’s treatise was a
reaction to the rise of Abhidharma movement, which attempted to
rigorously systematize our understanding of the world. While this is
instrumentally useful, it’s wrong to consider any form of conditioned knowledge
to be universally true.</p>
<p>There are interesting parallels today with the rise of a physicalist
metaphysical fundamentalism. The Standard Model is undoubtedly useful in
helping us make reliably model certain systems, but that doesn’t mean it
represents a fundamental truth about the universe. Ultimately, it too is just
another “empty” conceptual construct.</p>
