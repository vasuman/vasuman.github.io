<p><strong>FiSh</strong> is a program that helps users share files simply and quickly over local
networks that uses IP multicast for peer discovery. Written in Python. Uses
Twisted and QT.</p>
<h3 id="why-">Why?</h3>
<p>I realized that a lot of people were using pendrives <strong>a lot</strong> to
transfer files between machines that were really close. I wanted a
program with which I could simply host an ad-hoc network, have people
connect to it and simply <em>start sharing files</em>. FiSh was my attempt at
doing that.</p>
<h3 id="how-">How?</h3>
<p>The workflow of the program is quite simple.</p>
<ul>
<li>The program first indexes local shared folders.</li>
<li>It then uses IP multicast for peer discovery and broadcasts its
presence.</li>
<li>The user gets a list of avaliable peers.</li>
<li>They then picks a peer to connect to and retrieves that peer’s file
list.</li>
<li>They can then pick any of that peer’s shared files to download.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="name">Name</h3>
<p>FiSh stands for “Fi”le “Sh”aring.</p>
<h3 id="note">Note</h3>
<p>I wrote this program a while back while I was just learning Python and
it was a pretty enlightening experience but I don’t work on it
anymore.</p>
