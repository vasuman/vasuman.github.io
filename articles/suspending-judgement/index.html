<p>The modern human is conditioned to think in terms of strict <strong>dichotomies</strong>.</p>
<p>News reports must be judged as real or fake. One’s political beliefs must
belong exclusively to the left or the right. The existence of a higher power
must either be constantly affirmed or vehemently denied.</p>
<p>We’re forced to <strong>choose between two extremes</strong>. And led to believe that a
refusal to endorse one position is tacit support for its opposite.</p>
<p>This kind of thinking stems from an intuitively sound principle, known as the
<strong>law of excluded middle</strong>. It asserts that if a proposition isn’t true, its
negation must be true — there’s no other alternative. But, what if we
unexcluded the middle?</p>
<hr>
<p>For some perspective, let’s wind the clock back to the time of the Buddha,
around 600 BC. During this period, the Indian subcontinent is rife with
competing philosophies that conflict on a number of positions.</p>
<p>Among the major ideas under deliberation was the concept of <strong>other worlds</strong>.</p>
<p>On one side, there were materialists, like the Cārvāka, who denied the
existence of anything outside of our physical world. And on the other side,
were sects, like the Vedic Brahmins, that preached of the existence of beings
and the possibility of rebirth in other realms, like heaven (<em>svarga</em>) and
hell (<em>nāraka</em>).</p>
<p>The battle lines were drawn and most major schools were compelled to pick a
side. When someone asked the famous ascetic (<em>śramaṇa</em>) teacher Sanjaya
Belatthiputta what his views on the issue were, he is
<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato#dn2:30.8">reported</a> to have said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>evantipi me no, tathātipi me no, aññathātipi me no, notipi me no, no
notipi me no</em></p>
<p>I don’t say it’s like this. I don’t say it’s like that. I don’t say it’s
otherwise. I don’t say it’s not so. And I don’t deny it’s not so.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Sanjaya was a leading member of the Ajñāna school, which promoted a variety
of <strong>skeptical thought</strong>. Unfortunately, little is known about his life and
no primary sources of this school survive. Its philosophy is only known
through secondary references in Buddhist and Jain literature.</p>
<p>Two of Buddha’s prime disciples Sariputta and Moggallana, were both said to
be followers of Sanjaya before they switched camps. Some Jain texts also
claimed that Sanjaya was inspired by their doctrine and a follower of their
tradition.</p>
<p>When evaluating these sources, however, one must also keep in mind that these
commentaries <strong>aren’t truly objective</strong>. Since their actual aim was to
establish the superiority of their view by criticizing the doctrine of the
Ajñānikāhs.</p>
<hr>
<p>Regardless, the influence of Sanjaya’s ideas is clear in the early Buddhist
texts. In the Buddhist Pāli cannon, his view is described as being one of
“eternal equivocation” (<em>amarāvikkhepavāda</em>). The
<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#dn1:2.22.6">Brahmajālasutta</a> goes on
to list four reasons as to why someone would subscribe to such a view.</p>
<p>The first, is a genuine <strong>lack of knowledge</strong>. To claim complete knowledge
about a topic when you just have a surface understanding, is <strong>deceptive</strong>
and tantamount to lying. How many fields in which we hold strong positions
are we truly experts in?</p>
<p>Modern psychologists have discovered the <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/an-overview-of-the-dunning-kruger-effect-4160740">Dunning-Kruger
effect</a>,
in which we grossly <strong>overestimate our own cognitive ability</strong> when judging
ourselves. Perhaps it’s better to critically question your own expertise, the
next time you feel justified in having a strong opinion on something.</p>
<p>Second, was to <strong>relinquish grasping</strong> (<em>upādāna</em>). Grasping to a view leads
to craving (<em>rāga</em>) and aversion (<em>dveṣa</em>), which are considered unwholesome
mental qualities that are meant to be avoided.</p>
<p>Our views are generally based on limited information and riddled with biases.
Despite this, we believe that our view is sanctified and that the other side
is corrupt. Kicking off a <strong>metaphorical crusade</strong> against the heresy, that
just perpetuates anguish.</p>
<p>Third, is the urge to <strong>avoid confrontation</strong> with others who enjoy arguing.
This motivates those who value mental equanimity more the praise and
validation gained by engaging in polemic debate.</p>
<p>It’s hard to find any position that is universally agreed upon. Holding a
strong opinion on a particularly contentious topic, is bound to evoke an
equally strong response from the other side. The best you can do in such
heated situations, in order to <strong>maintain tranquility</strong>, is to refrain from
picking a side.</p>
<p>And finally, some followers of this sect are rather uncharitably described as
simply being <strong>dull and stupid</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Buddha also adopted a similar strategy when dealing with abstract
<strong>metaphysical speculations</strong>. He refused to endorse any alternative when
presented with questions on the eternity of the universe, the nature of the
soul or the state of a liberated person after death.</p>
<p>One interpretation is that these questions <strong>weren’t considered relevant</strong> to
the ultimate goal of ending suffering.</p>
<p>This point is illustrated in the <strong>parable of the arrow</strong>. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn63/en/sujato">The
story</a> describes a man who has been
shot with a poisoned arrow. When a doctor arrives to treat his wound, he
refuses treatment until someone tells him the name, caste and appearance of
the person who shot the arrow first.</p>
<p>Metaphysical questions are considered similar to those of the wounded person
refusing treatment. They <strong>distract</strong> from the more immediate task at hand,
which was to renounce all craving and clinging. Including the clinging to
absolutist metaphysical views.</p>
<p>A different kind of justification is found in another
<a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn72/en/sujato">discourse</a>, when a disciple isn’t
satisfied by the Buddha’s lack of endorsement of any major metaphysical
theory.</p>
<p>In response, Buddha uses the <strong>example of a fire</strong>. He asks the disciple if a
fire was extinguished, and someone asked him in <strong>which direction the fire
went</strong> — north, south, east or west — how would he reply?</p>
<p>This is analogous to the contemporary philosophical notion of a <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/category-mistakes">category
mistake</a>. It’s
pointless to try to affirm the truth or falsity of a statement like, “the
number seven is green”. Because, the statement itself is based on a
fundamentally <strong>flawed presumption</strong> — the idea that numbers have colors.</p>
<p>The influence of the Ajñānikāhs is also evident in later Buddhism with the
development of Madhyamaka thought. It’s interesting to note that Nagarjuna
makes use of a similar kind of fourfold negation (<em>catuṣkoṭi</em>) as Sanjaya in
his denial of intrinsic essence.</p>
<hr>
<p>Nearly one and a half millennia after the time of Sanjaya, the commentary of
the Jain philosopher Silanka on the doctrine of the Ajñānikāhs, hints at the
development of a much stronger flavor of skepticism.</p>
<p>These skeptics targeted not just metaphysical speculation, but also began
<strong>attacking foundational epistemic theories</strong>. Bringing into doubt, the
validity of all knowledge. They believed that all claims of knowledge were
inaccurate, and opted to stay undecided on all matters.</p>
<p>So, is it appropriate to suspend judgement at all times? Well, if you asked
Sanjaya what he thought, he’d probably say that he neither agrees nor
disagrees.</p>
