<p>I recently completed a 10-day
Vipassana <a href="http://dhamma.org/">retreat</a>, which was a pretty
enlightening experience. I’d highly recommend it to anyone seeking
to reduce their suffering. I learned a lot, but my key takeaway
from the entire exercise is that our suffering arises from not
accepting the reality of things as they are.</p>
<p>Our minds are constantly engaged in constructing a fictional ideal
world conditioned by our desires while heedlessly ignoring the
true nature of things. This breeds nothing but misery.</p>
<p>The Sanskrit word <em>yathābhūtaṃ</em> is a compounding of the words for
“in whatever manner” (<em>yathā</em>) and “reality” (<em>bhūta</em>), which
approximately translates to “reality however it is”. It features
in <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.126/en/sujato">several</a> <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.160/en/sujato">discourses</a> in
the Pali Canon, and is referenced in the context of developing the
right understanding (<em>sammādiṭṭhi</em>) of the nature of things by
objectively observing reality as it manifests.</p>
<h2 id="reality-is-now">Reality is Now</h2>
<p>True objectivity is only possible in the present moment. Our
recollections of the past are littered
with <a href="http://www.aboutintelligence.co.uk/memory-biases.html">biases</a>.
Predictions of the future are probabilistic and tinged by our
expectations.</p>
<p>Objectively observing reality keeps one grounded in the present
moment and makes it easier to detect distracting thoughts. If a
thought doesn’t relate to the phenomenal experience of the present
moment, it doesn’t reflect the true nature of things. This is also
a key aspect of the whole mindfulness movement — being aware of
the present moment.</p>
<h2 id="breathing-naturally">Breathing Naturally</h2>
<p>Before attending the retreat, my self-taught meditation practice
involved actively controlling the flow of breath. However, early
on in the instruction, we were discouraged from trying to control
the breath and asked to just observe its natural flow. It didn’t
matter whether it was fast, slow, shallow or deep — you were
simply meant to observe it as it was.</p>
<p>Initially, after changing my technique, I found myself more easily
distracted. I realized that the sense of agency I had in
consciously breathing helped keep my mind occupied. Sustaining
bare attention with no volitional impulse was a lot more
challenging. It felt like I was trying to meditate on hard mode.</p>
<p>However, as time went by, I slowly started seeing the actual
purpose behind this.</p>
<h2 id="remaining-equanimous">Remaining Equanimous</h2>
<p>Part of the goal is also to help cultivate the virtue of
equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em>). While it is possible to attain a certain
level of tranquility by controlling the breath, the intentionality
behind the act of control also becomes a roadblock to achieving
perfect stillness.</p>
<p>Controlling the breath implies a desired way of breathing. But, to
be truly equanimous, no particular way must be preferable over any
other. One must simply accept the state of things as they are,
with no yearning to change it.</p>
<p>I also noticed that as I became more equanimous, I was less
critical of myself upon noticing distraction. Instead of hating
myself for losing focus, or becoming averse to the object of my
distraction, I would simply acknowledge the reality of the present
moment — that the mind had wandered off — and calmly get back to
focusing on the breath.</p>
<h2 id="seeds-of-suffering">Seeds of Suffering</h2>
<p>The urge to control can also be interpreted as a form of desire
(<em>taṇhā</em>), and Buddhist doctrine considers desire to be the source
of all suffering (<em>dukkha samudaya</em>). Desire can be further broken
down into an attachment (<em>rāga</em>) to pleasurable sensations and
aversion (<em>dveṣa</em>) to unpleasant sensations.</p>
<p>It’s perhaps obvious why unpleasant sensations are a source of
suffering, but what about pleasant sensations? It certainly feels
like pleasure is the very antithesis of suffering. But,
objectively observing the nature of phenomenal experiences will
show you that every pleasurable feeling contains the seeds of
suffering within it.</p>
<h2 id="sensations-are-impermanent">Sensations are Impermanent</h2>
<p>One of the undeniable characteristics of all experiences is their
impermanence (<em>anicca</em>). This means that all pleasurable feelings
will at some point fade away. Relishing in a pleasant feeling
naturally causes an attachment to that feeling. Subsequently
leading to a craving for the same feeling when it eventually
ceases.</p>
<p>It’s this craving for pleasure that manifests as suffering.
Anybody who has personally dealt with any form of addiction can
attest to the magnitude of suffering in craving for a high.</p>
<p>Psychologists term this phenomenon <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/hedonic-treadmill/">hedonic
adaptation</a>.
According to this theory, the mind begins to adapt to a positive
feeling leading an eventual regression to the baseline state.
Which is simply another way of explaining the transient nature of
all pleasurable sensations.</p>
<h2 id="pain-also-passes">Pain Also Passes</h2>
<p>On a more positive note, this impermanence also applies to
unpleasant sensations like pain. Being unaccustomed to maintaining
my posture for extended periods of time, I would regularly move my
arms and legs upon feeling even mild discomfort.</p>
<p>Then, they introduced the “strong determination” (<em>adhiṭṭhāna</em>)
sittings, where you were supposed to maintain your body posture
without any major movement for a whole hour. Instead of reacting
to every minor ache, I decided to observe its impermanence. But,
it seemed like the longer I waited for the pain to pass, the more
it intensified.</p>
<p>Then, I realized that I wasn’t objectively watching the sensation,
I was observing it while covertly wishing that it stopped. The
craving for cessation took on a life of its own and exaggerated
the pain. Keeping my attention impartially focussed on the
sensation without willing it to stop helped me notice that the
pain also eventually faded.</p>
<h2 id="craving-enlightenment">Craving Enlightenment</h2>
<p>Another major lesson for me was that my original motivation for
attending the retreat was also a hindrance to making progress on
the path. I came in hoping to experience some extreme state of
bliss. But as we neared the end and no such feeling arose, I
started getting anxious.</p>
<p>The recorded instructions spoke of subtle sensations all over the
body, but I didn’t feel any such thing. Was I a bad meditator,
doing something wrong or was the technique itself flawed? I
started thinking of ways to generate such sensations — I could
layer up heavily and I should feel the prickle of heat all over my
body.</p>
<p>But then, it was explained that it didn’t matter what you were
feeling — pleasurable pulsation, annoying itch, or nothing at all
— your job was to impersonally observe and accept it. The aim of
the technique is to train your equanimity and awareness by
observing sensations, without craving for particular sensations or
trying to artificially manufacture them.</p>
<p>Attaining enlightenment doesn’t require experiencing some form of
transcendence — although it may naturally occur on the path. The
ultimate goal is to end suffering by relinquishing all forms of
desire, including the desire for enlightenment itself.</p>
